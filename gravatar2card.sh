# Usage: gravatar2card email "full name"
#
# Calculate email hash and obtain a 40x40 PNG from Gravatar
# and convert image to BASE64. Create a JSON payload to be published
# retained to owntracks/username/device/info
#
# You probably want to do this:
#
# gravatar2card.sh email-address  "Jane Jolie" > card.json
# mosquitto_pub -t owntracks/jane/phone/info -r -f card.json
#
# Note: the two commands cannot be piplelined (mosquitto_pub -l)
# because of a bug in mosquitto_pub: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=478917
# If you have a newer version it should work fine.
